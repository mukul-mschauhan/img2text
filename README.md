# Image to Text Annotation using Google Gemini

This project is a web-based Image to Text Annotation tool built using **Streamlit** and **Google Gemini**. The application allows users to upload an image, provide an optional input prompt, and get text annotations based on the content of the image using the Gemini AI model.

## Features

- Upload an image (jpg, jpeg, png formats supported)
- Provide an optional prompt for context or leave it blank
- Generate text annotations using Google Gemini's `gemini-1.5-flash` model
- Display the uploaded image with a generated response on the same page
